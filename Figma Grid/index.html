                    Steinberg Meets the Eameses
                </h3>

                <p>
                    In the summer of 1950, 
                    the artist Saul Steinberg spent a day at play within 
                    the Office of Charles and Ray Eames resultingi in an 
                    iconic collaboration.

                <p>
                    Eames chairs have always stolen the spotlight, 
                    but an adjacent thirty-year legacy of table designs 
                    demonstrates the designer’s same thoughtful approach 
                    to problem-solving.

                <p>
                    From scraps and scribbles to maquettes and models, 
                    the Eames Collection contains countless examples that 
                    illustrate Ray Eames’s unique working methods and iconic collaborations.
