                <p> Lagoon sang and produced by Rich Brian. <br>
                    Realeased in 2022 with the album of Brightside, 
                    Lagoon brings a rich and fastbeat style of rap that Rich Brian has adapted and evolved.
                    Alongside other songs like Getcho Mans, Sunny and New Tooth, Lagoon punches you in the face 
                    as when you press play and gives you the chills as it slows down towards the end.
