            <h2>Overview and History</h2>
            <p>
                    Two million years ago, a series of glacial flows began to cross what we know now as 
                New York. These large bodies of ice carved trenches into the earth and grinded itself to form 
                the lakes we know today. The term finger lakes refers to a long, narrow body of water and it is one of 
                the many beauties that we have in the USA. <br>
                
                Early settlers are from Native Americans who believed that these lakes were the creation of the Great Spirit's 
                fingerprints. They lived here long before the European settlers arrived. During the Revolutionary War some tribes
                sided with the British while others sided with the Americans. This caused their own Civil War between the tribes and 
                the outcome was determined when the British decided to leave and surrender the land to the Americans. <br>
                
                After the war, many 
                of the land that belonged to the Native Americans were put up to be sold and given to veterans with the intent of preserving the Iroquois 
                Tribe. Reservations were built and time passed. The Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention took place near the Finger Lakes and paved way to 
                equal rights, social rights, voting rights, and religious rights. By the 1900s salt mining became popular and so land was being bought and sold 
                near the Finger Lakes to capitalize on the salt mining industry and some still run to this day. <br>
